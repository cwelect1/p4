## Known Bugs/Future fixes/enhancements
  - Client Side validation not implemented.
  - Server Side validation doesn't report issues to end user.
  - Cascading delete doesn't work (for the seeded data that has relationships). Constraint error occurs.
  - Dashboard charts not complete. Only Smoke tests are being calculated based on actual test data. Other 2 charts are hard coded.
  - Individual Test Runs page not finished (linked from ID on Dashboard page).
  - Most nav links point to same placholder page. Will customize for each type (partner, infrastructure, etc...)
  - Placeholder links in top nav go to placeholder pages.

## Notes to TA
 - I didn't implement authentication yet, so there is no need to login.
